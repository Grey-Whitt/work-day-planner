# Work Day Scheduler

## Goal For This Project

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
Goal for this project was to create a day planner for standard business hours. Past times turn grey, present time is red, 
and future times are green. The planner updates its self every minute to ensure it stays accurate throughout the day. Tasks are erased at midnight every night. 

Some HTML and CSS were provided.
